- Expo CLI (for React Native development) or appropriate app store accounts for deployment

### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/canteen-management-app.git
   cd canteen-management-app/backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Configure your environment variables in `config.js` (including MongoDB URI and Stripe credentials).
4. Start the server:

   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React Native application:
